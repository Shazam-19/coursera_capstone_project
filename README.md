# loan-status-classifier

Final project of [Machine Learning with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python) course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)

This project uses 4 classification algorithms and compares their evaluation to find the best one:
- *K Nearest Neighbor (KNN)*
- *Decision Tree*
- *Support Vector Machine (SVM)*
- *Logistic Regression*

I got a full grade of 25/25 after my _peers_ in the course reviewed my submission which matched the required points were given in the description of the project.
